# Project Structure

> **Deprecated.** This document has been consolidated into the architecture skill.

The authoritative web project structure reference is now maintained at:

`~/.claude/skills/architecture/references/web.md`

That file defines the 3-tier architecture (`01-presentation/` -> `02-logic/` -> `03-data/`), dependency flow rules, naming conventions, red flags, project infrastructure patterns, and recommended validators.

To scaffold a new web project, copy the template from `web/templates/web-project/`.
