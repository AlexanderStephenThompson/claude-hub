## Customization Notes

- **Adjust L1 arenas** to match your actual life domains. If you don't do creative work, drop `Creative/` and add whatever fits.
- **L2 will vary** based on what you actually do. Don't create empty folders for hypothetical outcomes.
- **L3 emerges naturally** — don't pre-build it. Let structure follow work.
- **Archive at L2** — when a project or tax year is done, move it to `_Archive/` within its arena.
