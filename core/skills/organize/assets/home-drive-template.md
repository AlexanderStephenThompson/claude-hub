## Customization Notes

- **Adjust L1 arenas** to match your actual life domains. Drop what doesn't apply, add what does.
- **L2 will vary** based on what you actually do. Don't create empty folders for hypothetical outcomes.
- **L3 emerges naturally** — don't pre-build it. Let structure follow work.
- **Archive at L2** — when a project or tax year is done, move it to `Archive/` within its arena.
