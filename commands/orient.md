# Orient: Project Context Loading

Before responding to any tasks, thoroughly orient yourself to this project.

## Required Actions

1. **Read the project root** - List files and directories to understand structure
2. **Read README.md** (if exists) - Understand purpose, setup, and conventions
3. **Read CLAUDE.md** (if exists) - Follow any AI-specific instructions
4. **Scan key config files** - package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc. to understand dependencies and scripts
5. **Identify the tech stack** - Languages, frameworks, build tools, testing setup
6. **Note any existing patterns** - Code organization, naming conventions, architectural decisions

## Output Format

After orientation, provide a brief summary:

**Project:** [name and one-line purpose]
**Stack:** [primary technologies]
**Structure:** [key directories and what they contain]
**Entry points:** [main files, scripts, or commands]
**Conventions:** [any notable patterns or rules]
**Ready for:** [what kinds of tasks you're now equipped to help with]

Keep the summary concise—this is a handshake, not a dissertation.
