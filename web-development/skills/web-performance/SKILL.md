# Web Performance Skill

**Version:** 1.0
**Stack:** Apollo Client/Server + Redis + CloudFront + S3

Performance problems are invisible during development. Local servers are fast. Test data is small. You don't notice the 3MB bundle, the N+1 queries, or the full-table scan until real users on real connections with real data report that the page takes 8 seconds to load. By then, fixing it requires rearchitecting the caching layer, splitting the bundle, and rewriting queries — all at once, under pressure.

Performance patterns applied from the start are cheap. Performance fixes applied after launch are expensive. These rules are the cheap version.

## Core Principles

1. **Measure First** — Profile before optimizing. Don't guess.
2. **Cache at Every Layer** — CDN → API → Database → In-Memory.
3. **Minimize Payload** — Send only what's needed.
4. **Defer Non-Critical** — Load critical path first, everything else later.
5. **Perceived Performance** — Optimistic UI makes things feel faster.

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | What It Measures | Target | Critical |
|--------|------------------|--------|----------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Main content loaded | < 2.5s | < 4s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Input responsiveness | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability | < 0.1 | < 0.25 |

## Apollo Client Caching

Configure `InMemoryCache` with type policies for pagination merging and computed fields. Use `cache-and-network` as default fetch policy (stale-while-revalidate). Use optimistic updates for mutations to make UI feel instant.

### Fetch Policies

| Policy | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `cache-first` | Static data (categories, config) |
| `cache-and-network` | Data that changes (products, user data) |
| `network-only` | Always fresh (order status, real-time) |
| `cache-only` | Offline mode, known-cached data |

See `assets/caching-patterns.md` for cache configuration, fetch policy examples, and optimistic update patterns.

---

## Redis Caching

Cache-aside pattern: check cache → miss → fetch DB → store in cache. Invalidate on writes. Use tag-based invalidation for list queries.

### TTL Guidelines

| Data Type | TTL | Reason |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Static config | 24h+ | Rarely changes |
| Product catalog | 1h | Changes occasionally |
| User sessions | 30m | Security balance |
| Cart data | 7d | User convenience |
| Search results | 5m | Balance freshness/speed |
| Real-time data | No cache | Must be live |

See `assets/caching-patterns.md` for Redis cache service, cache-aside pattern, and invalidation examples.

---

## CloudFront & S3 Optimization

Immutable assets (hashed filenames) get 365-day cache. API routes get no CDN caching. Images get resize-on-demand with WebP format, lazy loading, and 2x srcSet for retina.

See `assets/caching-patterns.md` for CDK configuration and image optimization component.

---

## Bundle Optimization

Route-based code splitting with `React.lazy`. Dynamic imports for heavy libraries (load only when needed). Analyze with `source-map-explorer`.

### Bundle Size Guidelines

| Category | Target | Action if Exceeded |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Initial JS | < 100KB gzipped | Code split, tree shake |
| Vendor chunk | < 150KB gzipped | Lazy load, find alternatives |
| Route chunk | < 50KB gzipped | Split further |
| Total initial load | < 200KB gzipped | Audit dependencies |

See `assets/optimization-patterns.md` for code splitting, dynamic import, and bundle analysis examples.

---

## React Performance

Use `useMemo` for expensive computations, `useCallback` for stable callbacks passed to memoized children, and `memo` for list item components. Don't memoize simple values, always-changing values, or handlers on non-memoized children. Use virtualization for long lists (100+ items).

See `assets/optimization-patterns.md` for memoization, when-NOT-to-memoize, and virtualization examples.

---

## Database Performance

Select only needed fields. Use `include` sparingly. Use raw queries for complex aggregations. Add compound indices on filtered/sorted columns.

See `assets/optimization-patterns.md` for Prisma query optimization and index strategy.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Fetching all fields** | Over-fetching, slow | Select only needed fields |
| **No pagination** | Memory issues, slow | Cursor-based pagination |
| **Cache everything** | Stale data, complexity | Cache strategically by TTL |
| **Premature optimization** | Wasted effort | Measure first, optimize hotspots |
| **Sync heavy operations** | Blocks response | Background jobs (Bull) |
| **No CDN for static assets** | Slow global delivery | CloudFront for static files |
| **Unoptimized images** | Huge downloads | Resize, compress, WebP |
| **Blocking bundle** | Slow initial load | Code split, lazy load |

## When to Consider Alternatives

| Situation | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| Global real-time data | Redis Pub/Sub or WebSockets |

| Large file uploads | Direct S3 presigned URLs |
| Search-heavy | Elasticsearch or Algolia |
| Edge computing needs | CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge |
