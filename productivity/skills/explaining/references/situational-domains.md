# Situational Framework — Domain Mappings

The Situational framework (Establish Context → Reveal Problem/Opportunity → Solve) maps naturally onto communication patterns across domains. The 3-phase structure is universal — only the vocabulary changes.

## Core Mappings

| Context / Domain | Natural Mapping | Example Flow |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Storytelling** (3-Act Structure) | Setup → Conflict → Resolution | 1. "Once upon a time..." 2. "Then something went wrong." 3. "Here's how it changed." |
| **Scientific Method** | Observation → Question → Conclusion | 1. "Here's what we observed." 2. "This raised a question." 3. "Testing showed the answer." |
| **Design Thinking** | Empathize → Define → Ideate/Test | 1. "We learned what users struggle with." 2. "Their workflow breaks here." 3. "We tested a fix — it worked." |
| **Data Storytelling** | Context → Insight → Recommendation | 1. "This metric has doubled since last quarter." 2. "That growth hides inefficiency." 3. "We recommend streamlining X." |
| **Consulting Deck Flow** | Situation → Problem → Solution | 1. "Here's the market situation." 2. "Margins are shrinking." 3. "Our plan restores profitability." |
| **Classroom Teaching** | Explain → Illustrate → Apply | 1. "Here's the concept." 2. "Here's where people get stuck." 3. "Here's how to use it correctly." |
| **Marketing Funnel** | Awareness → Interest → Conversion | 1. "You want X." 2. "But you struggle with Y." 3. "Our product fixes that — here's proof." |

## Expanded Domain Patterns

These extend the core mappings with richer phase content for domains that benefit from more nuance.

### Teaching (Expanded)

**Mapping:** Purpose framing + Shared value → Problem framing + Example tension → Proof + Application

| Phase | What to Do |
|-------|-----------|
| **Establish Context** | "Here's what matters." Frame the purpose of learning this concept. Connect it to something the learner already values. |
| **Reveal Problem** | "Here's what confuses most people." Name the common misconception or difficulty. Use a specific example to make the tension tangible. |
| **Solve** | "Here's how it really works — and how to apply it." Provide the correct mental model with proof, then translate it into action the learner can take. |

### Marketing (Expanded)

**Mapping:** Hook + Desire mapping → Agitate + Opportunity → Visualization + CTA

| Phase | What to Do |
|-------|-----------|
| **Establish Context** | "You've wanted this." Hook the audience and map to a desire they already have. |
| **Reveal Problem** | "Here's what's holding you back." Agitate the gap between desire and reality. Frame the opportunity cost. |
| **Solve** | "This approach gets you there — try it today." Paint the improved state vividly, then provide a clear call to action. |

### Leadership Briefing

**Mapping:** Situational framing → Problem + Implication → Solution + Reasoning + Next Step

| Phase | What to Do |
|-------|-----------|
| **Establish Context** | "Here's where we stand." Ground the audience in the current situation with key facts. No opinion yet — just orientation. |
| **Reveal Problem** | "Here's the challenge." Name the specific problem and expand its implications. What happens if we don't act? |
| **Solve** | "Here's our plan and why it'll work." Present the recommendation with supporting reasoning. End with concrete next steps and ownership. |

### Data Storytelling (Expanded)

**Mapping:** BLUF + Context metric → Opportunity framing → Proof (visual data) + Action

| Phase | What to Do |
|-------|-----------|
| **Establish Context** | "Our uptime dropped 12%." Lead with the bottom line (BLUF), then provide the context metric. |
| **Reveal Problem** | "That signals deeper system inefficiency." Reframe the data point as a symptom of a larger opportunity or risk. |
| **Solve** | "We fix it by automating alerts — projected to restore 98% uptime." Support with visual data or projections. End with a specific action. |

## How to Use These Mappings

1. **Identify your domain** — what kind of communication is this? (Teaching, presenting data, briefing leadership, telling a story, selling an idea)
2. **Map the phases** — use the domain-specific vocabulary so the explanation *feels* native to that context.
3. **Don't force it** — if your situation doesn't map cleanly to a domain pattern, use the general Situational framework directly. The phases are the same regardless of vocabulary.

### The Universal Pattern Underneath

Every domain mapping is a surface variation of the same deep structure:

```
Phase 1: Orient (where are we?)
Phase 2: Tension (what's at stake?)
Phase 3: Resolution (what do we do?)
```

When a domain mapping feels forced, drop back to this core. The power is in the *sequence*, not the labels.
