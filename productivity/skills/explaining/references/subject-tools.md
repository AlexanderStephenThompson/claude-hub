# Subject Tools — Technique Catalog by Phase

Techniques organized by the Subject framework phase they serve. Each technique can be used independently within any explanation — pick based on what the phase needs, not the topic.

---

## Phase 1: Context — Anchor Understanding

*What does the listener need to know before the mechanism makes sense?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Simple Definition** | One sentence that captures the essence without jargon. "X is a system for doing Y." | Starting any explanation — the irreducible core |
| **Familiar Bridge** | Connect the unknown to something the listener already knows. "You know how X works? This is similar, except..." | Abstract or technical concepts that have everyday parallels |
| **Origin Story** | Explain why the thing exists. "This was created because..." or "This exists to solve..." | Concepts that make more sense once you know the problem they were invented to fix |
| **Scope Framing** | Draw boundaries. "This is part of [bigger thing]" or "This is not [common confusion]." | Concepts easily confused with related ideas, or concepts that seem bigger or smaller than they are |
| **Assumption Reset** | Challenge what the listener thinks they know. "Most people assume X, but actually..." | Topics where the listener's existing mental model will interfere with understanding |
| **Audience Hook** | Connect to something the listener already cares about. "If you've ever struggled with X, this is what's behind it." | Explanations where the listener might not see why the topic is relevant to them |
| **Semantic Rename** | Give the thing an intuitive name that describes what it actually does, before or alongside introducing the official term. "DNS — think of it as the internet's address book." | Concepts with jargon names, acronyms, or historically arbitrary labels that don't communicate what the thing does |

## Phase 2: Content — Show How It Works

*How does this thing actually work, in concrete terms?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Sequential Walkthrough** | Break the process into ordered steps. "First A happens, then B, then C." | Processes, workflows, anything with a clear order of operations |
| **Component Breakdown** | Decompose into parts. "It has three main pieces..." | Systems, frameworks, or objects with distinct sub-parts |
| **Spatial/Visual Metaphor** | Map the concept onto something you can picture. "Think of it as a pipeline..." or "Imagine a tree where..." | Abstract concepts that become clearer with a spatial model |
| **Compare and Contrast** | Define by showing what it is and what it isn't. "Unlike X, this does Y. Similar to Z, but with..." | Concepts in a crowded field, or concepts the listener might confuse with something adjacent |
| **Worked Example** | Walk through a specific instance. "Let's say you have... Here's what happens." | Anything that's clearer in practice than in theory — rules, formulas, processes |
| **Cause-and-Effect Chain** | Follow the dominoes. "When A happens, it causes B, which leads to C." | Mechanisms, natural processes, or systems where understanding *why* each step follows matters |

## Phase 3: Connection — Translate Meaning

*Why does this matter, and what does it change for the listener?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Personal Application** | Make it actionable. "This means you can..." or "Next time you see X, try..." | Practical topics where the listener can immediately use what they learned |
| **Surprising Implication** | Reveal a non-obvious consequence. "What most people miss is..." | Topics where the real insight isn't the mechanism itself but what it reveals |
| **Universal Principle** | Extract the deeper lesson. "The bigger idea here is..." | Topics that illustrate a pattern that appears across many domains |
| **Future Projection** | Show how understanding changes perception. "Once you see this, you'll start noticing..." | Concepts that reframe how the listener sees the world — the "can't unsee it" effect |
| **Transfer** | Connect to other domains. "This same principle applies in..." | Specialized topics that have broader relevance the listener wouldn't expect |
| **Reframe** | Redefine what the topic is really about. "So X isn't actually about [surface thing] — it's about [deeper thing]." | Topics where the conventional understanding is technically correct but misses the point |

## Quick Selection Guide

Match the technique to what your explanation needs in the moment:

| You Need... | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| **A starting point for any topic** | Simple Definition |
| **To overcome "why should I care?"** | Audience Hook or Assumption Reset |
| **To make something abstract feel real** | Spatial/Visual Metaphor or Worked Example |
| **To show how pieces fit together** | Component Breakdown or Sequential Walkthrough |
| **To distinguish from similar concepts** | Compare and Contrast or Scope Framing |
| **To land the "so what?"** | Surprising Implication or Reframe |
| **To make it stick beyond this conversation** | Universal Principle or Future Projection |
| **To make a jargon name intuitive** | Semantic Rename |

## Usage Notes

- **One or two techniques per phase is usually enough.** Stacking a Simple Definition with a Familiar Bridge in Context is natural. Stacking all six Context techniques is a lecture.
- **The phase determines the goal; the technique determines the delivery.** Pick your phase first (Orient / Explain / Connect), then choose the technique that fits the content.
- **Some techniques span phases.** A Spatial/Visual Metaphor introduced in Content might carry into Connection as the basis for a Reframe. That's fine — the technique catalog is organized by where the technique *starts*, not where it ends.
- **Techniques combine with Relatability Tools.** The tools in SKILL.md (simile, metaphor, analogy, personification, etc.) describe *how* you say something. The techniques here describe *what* you're doing structurally. A Familiar Bridge (technique) might use a simile (tool) to make the connection. They're complementary, not competing.

### Relationship to Relatability Tools

| Layer | What It Is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Technique** (this catalog) | The structural move — *what* you're doing in the explanation | Familiar Bridge: connect unknown to known |
| **Tool** (SKILL.md) | The rhetorical device — *how* you deliver it | Simile: "It's like a..."  |

A Familiar Bridge delivered through a simile: "Understanding CSS specificity is like understanding right-of-way rules in traffic — the more specific the rule, the more authority it has."

A Cause-and-Effect Chain delivered through personification: "The compiler reads your code top to bottom, and when it hits an error, it panics — it doesn't try to guess what you meant, it just stops."

The technique gives the explanation its shape. The tool gives it its voice.
