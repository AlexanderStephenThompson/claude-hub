# Contextual Tools — Technique Catalog by Phase

Techniques organized by the Situational framework phase they serve. Each technique can be used independently within any explanation — pick based on what the moment needs, not the domain.

---

## Phase 1: Setting Context

*What does the audience need to understand before anything else makes sense?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Derived From |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Hook or Opening Question** | Start with something intriguing, relatable, or challenging. | Hook-Story-Offer, Monroe's Sequence, AIDA |
| **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)** | Lead with the main point, then back it up. | Pyramid Principle, PREP |
| **Situational Framing** | Describe "where we are" or "what's true right now." | STAR, SCQA |
| **Purpose or "Why" Framing** | Begin with belief or purpose to anchor meaning. | Golden Circle |
| **Contrast Snapshot** | Show "before" vs. "after" at a glance to orient change. | Before-After-Bridge |
| **Shared Value Statement** | Align with something the audience already cares about. | PAS, AIDA ("Interest"), SPIN ("Situation") |

---

## Phase 2: Revealing Problems & Opportunities

*Why does this matter now — and what happens if nothing changes?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Derived From |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Problem Framing** | Name the specific issue or challenge. | PAS, PSB, SPIN |
| **Agitate or Visualize Impact** | Illustrate what happens if it's ignored (stakes). | PAS ("Agitate"), Monroe's ("Need") |
| **Opportunity Framing** | Flip it: show what could be gained instead. | SCQA ("Question"), Before-After-Bridge |
| **Implication Expansion** | Ask "So what?" to deepen urgency. | SPIN ("Implication") |
| **Desire Mapping** | Identify what the audience wants but doesn't have. | AIDA ("Desire") |
| **Conflict Story** | Use micro-narrative: "We tried X, but..." | Hook-Story-Offer, STAR ("Task") |

---

## Phase 3: Solutions

*What should we do, and why should they believe it will work?*

| Technique | How to Use It | Derived From |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Solution Presentation** | Clearly state the fix, insight, or recommendation. | PAS, PSB, SCQA ("Answer") |
| **Reasoning Chain** | Explain *why* it works before proving *that* it works. | PREP, Pyramid Principle |
| **Proof or Example** | Use data, story, or analogy to demonstrate success. | STAR ("Action-Result"), PEEL ("Evidence-Explain") |
| **Visualization of Success** | Paint the improved state or benefit. | Monroe's ("Visualization"), Before-After-Bridge |
| **Benefit Translation** | Link back to audience values ("What's in it for me?"). | FAB ("Benefit"), PSB |
| **Call to Action / Next Step** | End with direction or application. | AIDA ("Action"), STAR ("Result") |

## Quick Selection Guide

Match the technique to what your explanation needs in the moment:

| You Need... | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| **Attention or momentum** | Hook or BLUF |
| **Alignment** | Shared Value or Situational Framing |
| **Urgency** | Agitate, Implication, or Conflict Story |
| **Belief** | Reasoning Chain, Proof, or Analogy |
| **Action** | Clear Next Step or Call to Action |

## Usage Notes

- **These are not steps** — they're a toolbox. Pick the technique that fits the moment.
- **One technique per phase is usually enough.** Stacking multiple techniques in a single phase creates noise.
- **The phase determines the goal; the technique determines the delivery.** Choose your phase first (Orient / Tension / Resolution), then pick the technique that delivers it best.
- **Technique names come from established frameworks** (AIDA, PAS, SPIN, Monroe's Sequence, Pyramid Principle, etc.). The "Derived From" column is a reference, not a requirement — you don't need to know the source framework to use the technique.
