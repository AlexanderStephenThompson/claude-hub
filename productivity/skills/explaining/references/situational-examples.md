## Why You Should Learn to Cook

A personal behavior reframe — persuading someone that cooking is worth the investment.

### Short

1. **Establish Context:** "Most people skip cooking because they think it takes too much time. But eating out or ordering in takes time and money too — you just don't notice because it's spread across the week."
2. **Reveal Problem:** "The real cost isn't just financial. When you can't cook, you lose control over what you eat, how much you spend, and how you feel after meals."
3. **Solve:** "Learning five basic meals takes a few weekends. After that, you eat better, spend less, and stop making food decisions under pressure every single day."

### Medium

1. **Establish Context — Orient the Situation:**

   Cooking has an image problem. Most people imagine it as an hour-long production — recipes, grocery lists, dirty dishes — and decide it's not worth the effort. Takeout is right there. Meal kits exist. Someone else can handle it.

   And on any given night, that logic makes sense. But zoom out to a month, a year, a decade — and the pattern starts to look different. Not cooking isn't just a convenience preference. It's a slow accumulation of costs you don't see because they show up everywhere except the kitchen.

2. **Reveal Problem — Expose the Tension:**

   The obvious cost is money. Eating out regularly costs two to three times what the same food costs to make. But the less obvious cost is control. When someone else makes your food, they decide the portion size, the ingredients, the salt, the oil, the sugar. You're outsourcing one of the most fundamental decisions that affects your energy, your health, and your mood — and you're doing it to people whose incentive is to make food taste addictive, not nourishing.

   There's also a decision fatigue cost. Every meal without a default plan becomes a negotiation — what do I feel like, what's open, what's fast, what can I afford? People who cook don't face that friction. They already know what's for dinner. That frees up mental energy for everything else.

3. **Solve — Path Forward:**

   You don't need to become a chef. You need five meals you can make without thinking — things you actually like, built from overlapping ingredients so one grocery trip covers the week. A stir-fry, a pasta, a sheet-pan dinner, a grain bowl, and a soup will carry you through most weeks with variety and minimal effort.

   Start with one meal a week. Cook it three times until it's automatic. Then add another. Within a month, you'll have a rotation that's faster than deciding where to order from — and you'll have quietly reclaimed control over how you eat, what you spend, and how you feel. The skill compounds. The first meal is the hardest. Everything after that borrows from what you've already learned.

### Long

1. **Establish Context — Orient the Situation:**

   There's a modern story we tell ourselves about cooking: it's a hobby for people who have time, a passion project for foodies, a nice-to-have if you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, there are a hundred services designed to make sure you never have to do it. Delivery apps, meal kits, premade sections in every grocery store. The infrastructure of convenience is so good that cooking can feel like an affectation — something you'd do for fun, not because you need to.

   That framing is everywhere, and it's not accidental. There are entire industries that profit from you believing cooking is too hard, too slow, too complicated. But that belief doesn't hold up once you look at what not-cooking actually costs, beyond the line items on your bank statement.

2. **Reveal Problem — Expose the Tension:**

   The financial math is straightforward. An average takeout meal runs twelve to twenty dollars. The same meal cooked at home costs three to seven. Over a year, cooking most of your meals saves thousands — real money, not theoretical savings. But money is the surface-level argument, and it's not the most important one.

   The deeper cost is autonomy. When you can't cook, you are dependent — on restaurants, on apps, on whoever happens to be open, on whatever they decide to put in the food. You don't choose the oil. You don't choose the portion. You don't choose whether there's added sugar in the sauce. Every nutritional decision is outsourced to a business whose primary incentive is to make food taste compelling enough that you order again, not to make you feel good three hours later.

   Then there's the cognitive cost. Every meal without a plan becomes a micro-negotiation. What do I feel like? What's nearby? What's fast? What can I justify spending? People who can cook skip that entire loop. They know what's for dinner the same way they know where their keys are — it's not a decision, it's a default. That sounds small, but decision fatigue is cumulative. The mental bandwidth you spend solving food three times a day is bandwidth you're not spending on anything else.

   And there's a social cost that's harder to quantify. Cooking is one of the oldest forms of care. When you can make a meal for someone — a friend who's sick, a partner after a long day, a kid who's hungry — you're offering something that no delivery app replicates. Food made by someone who knows you and chose to spend time on it means something different from food that arrived in a bag. Losing the ability to cook doesn't just affect nutrition. It removes a language of connection.

3. **Solve — Path Forward:**

   The fix is smaller than it sounds. You don't need a kitchen full of equipment or a bookshelf of recipes. You need five meals — things you genuinely like eating, that you can make in thirty minutes or less, that share common base ingredients so one grocery trip covers the week.

   A stir-fry with whatever vegetables look good. A simple pasta with garlic, olive oil, and something green. A sheet-pan dinner where everything roasts together. A grain bowl that's a base plus toppings. A soup that's mostly simmering time. Those five cover most flavor cravings, most nutritional needs, and most weeknight time constraints. And they overlap enough that buying ingredients for all five barely costs more than buying for two.

   Start by making one of those meals once a week. Cook it three or four times until you stop needing the recipe. Then add a second. Within six weeks, you have a rotation that's genuinely faster than deciding where to order from — because there's no decision to make. The plan already exists.

   What surprises most people isn't that cooking saves money, though it does. It's that cooking saves *time*. The decision overhead disappears. The waiting-for-delivery overhead disappears. The "nothing sounds good" paralysis disappears. You trade thirty minutes of active effort for an hour of passive annoyance — and you get better food out of the deal.

   But the real shift isn't practical. It's psychological. Once you can cook, food stops being a problem to solve and becomes a tool you control. You eat when you want, what you want, in portions that make sense for your body. You stop feeling vaguely guilty about spending. You stop feeling vaguely helpless about health. You gain back a small but real piece of agency that most people don't realize they gave up — because they gave it up so gradually that it never felt like a choice.

## Why Small Teams Ship Faster

A professional persuasion — making the case that adding people slows projects down.

### Short

1. **Establish Context:** "When a project is important, the instinct is to add people. More hands means faster work — that's how it feels."
2. **Reveal Problem:** "But every person you add creates new communication lines. A team of 5 has 10 connections to manage. A team of 10 has 45. Coordination overhead grows faster than capacity."
3. **Solve:** "Keep the team small and give them clear ownership. Three to five people with authority to make decisions will ship faster than ten people who need consensus."

### Medium

1. **Establish Context — Orient the Situation:**

   In most organizations, a project's importance is signaled by the size of the team assigned to it. Critical launch? Staff it up. CEO priority? Add more engineers. The assumption is reasonable on the surface — more people means more throughput, and important work deserves more resources.

   This is so deeply baked into management thinking that questioning it feels counterintuitive. But the relationship between team size and output isn't linear. It curves — and past a certain point, it curves in the wrong direction.

2. **Reveal Problem — Expose the Tension:**

   The issue is coordination cost. Every person added to a team doesn't just add capacity — they add communication lines. Two people have one connection. Five people have ten. Ten people have forty-five. Those connections aren't free. They manifest as meetings, Slack threads, alignment sessions, status updates, and "quick syncs" that consume the hours you thought you were adding.

   There's a second cost that's harder to see: diffusion of ownership. On a team of three, everyone knows what everyone else is doing. Decisions happen fast because the people making them have full context. On a team of twelve, ownership fragments. People wait for approval. They duplicate work because they didn't know someone else started. They hedge their decisions because they're not sure it's their call to make. The team has more capacity on paper but moves slower in practice.

3. **Solve — Path Forward:**

   The fix isn't to under-staff important projects. It's to staff them differently. Keep the core team small — three to five people who own the outcome end to end. Give them decision-making authority so they don't need to escalate. Shield them from coordination overhead by having a single point of contact for stakeholders.

   If the project genuinely needs more people, partition the work into independent streams that each have their own small team. The goal is to keep any single group small enough that everyone has full context and no one waits for permission. Coordination between streams can happen at defined points instead of continuously. The result is a project that scales capacity without scaling overhead — and ships on the timeline the staffing was supposed to enable.

### Long

1. **Establish Context — Orient the Situation:**

   There's an unspoken equation in most organizations: importance equals headcount. When a project matters — when leadership is watching, when the deadline is tight, when the outcome is tied to revenue — the reflexive move is to add people. Staff it up. Show it's a priority by pointing at the size of the team.

   This instinct makes sense from the outside. If one engineer can ship a feature in ten weeks, ten engineers should ship it in one week. If three designers can produce a prototype in a month, six designers should do it in two weeks. The math feels obvious. And it is obvious — it's just wrong.

   The reason it's wrong has been documented for decades. Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1975. Jeff Bezos codified it as the "two-pizza team" rule. Every engineering leader who's lived through a staffing-up cycle has felt it firsthand. And yet the pattern repeats, because the failure mode is invisible from the top. The team looks busy. People are in meetings. Status reports are being filed. It looks like work — it just doesn't look like shipping.

2. **Reveal Problem — Expose the Tension:**

   The math that breaks the intuition is simple. The number of communication lines in a team grows as n(n-1)/2. Two people: one connection. Five people: ten connections. Ten people: forty-five. Twenty people: one hundred and ninety. Each connection is a potential point of misalignment, a meeting that needs scheduling, a decision that needs socializing, a piece of context that needs to be shared before someone can do their work.

   This isn't a management failure. It's physics. As teams grow, the proportion of time spent doing the work shrinks and the proportion spent coordinating the work grows. At some point — and it happens faster than anyone expects — you cross a threshold where adding the next person actually makes the project slower. Not because they're bad at their job. Because the coordination cost of integrating them exceeds the output they contribute.

   But the communication tax is only the visible cost. The invisible cost is worse: ownership dilution. On a team of four, everyone knows the full picture. They make decisions confidently because they have the context. They don't wait for sign-off because they know the boundaries. When something breaks, they fix it without asking who's responsible — because the answer is obviously "us."

   Scale that team to fifteen and watch what happens. People start to specialize not by skill but by territory. Knowledge fragments. Decisions that a small team would make in a five-minute conversation now require a meeting with seven people, three of whom are only there so they "have visibility." Engineers write code that overlaps with what someone on the other side of the team already wrote, because nobody has a complete view of the system anymore. Initiative evaporates — not because people stop caring, but because they stop feeling like it's their call.

   The cruelest part is that all of this is invisible to the people who made the staffing decision. From the outside, the team looks engaged. There are meetings happening. Tickets are moving across boards. The Slack channel is active. Every surface indicator says "this team is working hard." But working hard and shipping are different things, and the gap between them widens with every person you add.

3. **Solve — Path Forward:**

   The answer isn't to starve important projects of resources. It's to structure those resources differently.

   Keep the core team small — three to five people who own the outcome, have the authority to make decisions without escalation, and maintain full context on the entire scope. This isn't a rule of thumb. It's a structural constraint that preserves the two things large teams destroy: shared context and fast decisions.

   If the scope genuinely exceeds what a small team can handle, don't grow the team — split the work. Partition the project into independent streams, each owned by its own small group. Define clear interfaces between streams so teams can work in parallel without constant coordination. Let each team make decisions within their boundary. Sync at defined milestones, not in continuous meetings.

   This is how the organizations that ship fastest actually operate. Amazon doesn't run with two-pizza teams because Bezos read a management book. They run that way because they learned — through expensive failure — that the alternative doesn't scale. Spotify's squad model, Basecamp's small-team philosophy, and the consistent finding in open-source software that a tiny core team outperforms a sprawling contributor base all point to the same insight: human coordination doesn't scale linearly, so the systems that depend on it shouldn't try to.

   The hardest part isn't the structure. It's the organizational courage to look at a critical project and say "this team is big enough" when every instinct says to add more. It means trusting five people with something that feels like it needs fifty. It means accepting that the team will occasionally be bottlenecked on capacity — and recognizing that the alternative isn't more capacity, it's more overhead disguised as capacity.

   Small teams ship faster not because small is a virtue. They ship faster because they spend their time building instead of aligning. And alignment that doesn't produce decisions is just organized waiting.

## What Makes These Work

### Short Examples

- Each phase is 1-2 sentences. Just enough to orient, create tension, and resolve.
- Context names the situation without elaboration.
- Problem is concrete and specific — one clear tension.
- Solve is actionable and direct — what to do, immediately.

### Medium Examples

- Each phase is 4-6 sentences. Room to build the case with evidence.
- Context doesn't just name the situation — it names the *assumption* behind it, then unsettles it.
- Problem introduces a second, less obvious cost the listener hadn't considered.
- Solve is practical with a clear mechanism: not just "do X" but "do X because Y."

### Long Examples

- Each phase is multiple paragraphs. Room for narrative, evidence, and cumulative persuasion.
- Context traces the assumption back to its *origin* — why we think this way, and what reinforces it.
- Problem layers costs: surface → hidden → systemic. Each layer makes it harder to dismiss.
- Solve doesn't just prescribe — it reframes. The listener's understanding of the problem shifts, making the solution feel inevitable rather than imposed.
- Tone shifts from prescribing to revealing. The reader should feel like they arrived at the conclusion themselves.

### Key Differences from Subject Examples

The Subject framework teaches *what a thing is*. The Situational framework argues *why something should change*. That changes what each phase needs to accomplish:

| Phase | Subject (teaching) | Situational (persuading) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Orient: "Here's what this is" | Orient: "Here's what you currently believe" |
| **Phase 2** | Explain: "Here's how it works" | Tension: "Here's why that belief costs you" |
| **Phase 3** | Connect: "Here's why it matters" | Resolve: "Here's the better path, and why it works" |

The emotional arc is different. Subject explanations build understanding; Situational explanations build *motivation*. Context in Subject assumes curiosity. Context in Situational often has to create it — by naming an assumption the listener holds and gently revealing that it's incomplete.

### Creating Your Own

When writing a Situational explanation at any depth:

1. **Start with what the listener currently believes.** Don't start with the problem — start with the worldview that makes the problem invisible. Name their assumption without judgment.
2. **Reveal the cost of that assumption.** The best Situational explanations don't say "you're wrong." They say "here's what this is costing you that you haven't noticed." Layer the costs: obvious → hidden → systemic.
3. **Make the solve feel like a natural conclusion.** If you've done the first two phases well, the solve should feel almost obvious. The listener should think "of course" — not "I guess." The goal is inevitability, not persuasion.
