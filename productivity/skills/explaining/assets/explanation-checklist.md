# Explanation Checklist

Step-by-step execution checklist. Follow this order for every explanation.

---

## Step 1: Classify

- [ ] **Is the listener trying to understand a thing?** → Subject framework
- [ ] **Is the listener trying to decide, be persuaded, or change perspective?** → Situational framework
- [ ] **Not sure?** → Default to Subject

## Step 2: Choose Depth

- [ ] **Quick answer or summary?** → Short (1-2 sentences per phase)
- [ ] **Teaching or presenting?** → Medium (4-6 sentences per phase)
- [ ] **Deep-dive or narrative?** → Long (multiple paragraphs per phase)
- [ ] **Not sure?** → Default to Medium

## Step 3: Build the Structure

### If Subject:

- [ ] **Context — Anchor Understanding**
  - What is this thing?
  - Where does it fit?
  - Why does it exist?
  - Assume no prior knowledge
- [ ] **Content — Show How It Works**
  - How does it work, step by step?
  - Be concrete and example-driven
  - Avoid abstraction unless necessary
- [ ] **Connection — Translate Meaning**
  - Why does it matter?
  - When is it useful?
  - How does it change outcomes?

### If Situational:

- [ ] **Establish Context**
  - What's happening right now?
  - Why does it matter to the listener?
  - Connect to something they already value
- [ ] **Reveal Problem or Opportunity**
  - What's the gap between current state and better state?
  - What's at stake if nothing changes?
  - Spark curiosity or concern
- [ ] **Solve**
  - What's the path forward?
  - Why should they believe it works? (reasoning or evidence)
  - What are the concrete next steps?

## Step 4: Add Tools (Optional)

- [ ] Would a simile, metaphor, or analogy make a concept more vivid?
- [ ] Would an example or anecdote ground the abstract in experience?
- [ ] Would parallelism add rhythm to a summary or key point?
- [ ] **Stop if the tools aren't improving clarity** — structure carries the explanation

## Step 5: Verify

- [ ] No phase is skipped
- [ ] Context comes before Content
- [ ] The explanation ends with meaning, not mechanics
- [ ] Depth matches the audience and format
- [ ] Relatability tools enhance, not replace, structure

## Recovery: If Confusion Appears

- [ ] **Do NOT add more detail forward**
- [ ] Identify which phase is missing (usually Context)
- [ ] Rewind to that phase
- [ ] Rebuild the mental model
- [ ] Continue forward from there
