# Depth Comparison — Short / Medium / Long

Side-by-side comparison of all three explanation depths. Use this to calibrate how much to expose at each level.

---

| Aspect | Short | Medium | Long |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| **Purpose** | Deliver quick clarity — perfect for conversation, intros, or summaries. | Build full understanding — ideal for teaching, essays, or recorded segments. | Deepen understanding and perspective — ideal for storytelling, thought leadership, or immersive teaching. |
| **Length & Density** | 2-3 sentences per phase. Every line is functional, focused on the core idea. | 4-6 sentences per phase. Allows rhythm, contrast, and simple illustration. | Several paragraphs per phase. Explores context, nuance, and interconnected themes. |
| **Tone** | Crisp and direct — like concise teaching notes. | Natural, conversational — reads like how a good teacher talks. | Reflective and narrative — reads like a storyteller teaching through insight. |
| **Depth** | Defines and outlines the main idea. | Explains and contextualizes — includes why it matters and how it feels. | Expands into principles, examples, and metaphor — why it matters deeply and universally. |
| **Flow** | Modular and segmented — each phase stands on its own. | Smooth and progressive — transitions link ideas together. | Interwoven and recursive — ideas echo and evolve for emotional continuity. |
| **Emotional Engagement** | Minimal — clarity first. | Moderate — introduces relatability through tone, simple metaphors, or quick analogies. | High — integrates story, imagery, and extended analogy to build immersion and empathy. |
| **Relatability Tools** | Rare — only brief, functional comparisons ("Think of it like..."). | Occasional — similes and short analogies for accessibility. | Frequent — rich metaphors, analogies, and anecdotes used to create flow, meaning, and memorability. |
| **Best Use Cases** | Elevator pitch, summary, quick answer, memory cue. | Blog section, educational video, presentation voiceover, internal briefing. | Long-form article, keynote, essay, documentary narration, or deep-dive workshop. |

## Choosing Depth

**Default to Medium** unless you have a clear reason to go shorter or longer.

| Situation | Depth |
|-----------|-------|
| Quick answer, conversation, onboarding summary | Short |
| Teaching, blog post, presentation, team briefing | Medium |
| Keynote, essay, deep-dive, narrative content | Long |
| Unsure | Medium |

**Depth scales per-phase, not per-explanation.** Context can be Short even when Content is Medium. Scale each phase to its purpose — don't pad a phase just because another phase is longer.
